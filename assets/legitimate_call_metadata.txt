# Legitimate Customer Service Call Metadata

## Overview
This synthetic audio file simulates a legitimate customer service interaction
to serve as a baseline/control sample for testing SentinelGem's ability to
distinguish between legitimate calls and social engineering attempts.

## Embedded Patterns
1. **Professional Tone**: Clear, measured delivery
2. **Standard Scripts**: Common customer service language
3. **Natural Pauses**: Normal conversation rhythm
4. **Background**: Typical call center environment
5. **Verification Process**: Standard identity verification

## Expected Detection Results
- **Threat Type**: benign
- **Confidence Score**: 0.05-0.15 (low threat probability)
- **Detected Patterns**: professional_speech, standard_verification
- **Processing Time**: ~1.2 seconds (for 15-second audio)

## Technical Specifications
- **Format**: WAV (PCM)
- **Sample Rate**: 16kHz
- **Duration**: 15.0 seconds
- **Channels**: Mono
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit

## Testing Usage
This file serves as a control sample for:
- Baseline performance measurement
- False positive rate testing
- Legitimate call pattern recognition
- System calibration
- Accuracy validation

## Realistic Simulation
This synthetic audio represents normal customer service calls:
- Standard greeting protocols
- Professional verification procedures
- Clear communication style
- Normal background environment
- No manipulation tactics
