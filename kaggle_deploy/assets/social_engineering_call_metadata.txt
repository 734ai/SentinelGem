# Social Engineering Call Sample Metadata

## Overview
This synthetic audio file simulates a social engineering scam call with various
voice anomalies and suspicious patterns that SentinelGem's audio pipeline
is designed to detect and classify as a threat.

## Embedded Patterns
1. **Urgency Indicators**: Amplitude spikes at 3.0s, 7.5s, and 12.0s
2. **Stress Patterns**: Pitch modulation indicating caller stress/deception
3. **Background Noise**: Call center environment simulation
4. **Compression Artifacts**: VoIP call quality degradation
5. **Speech Pauses**: Unnatural speech rhythm with suspicious gaps

## Expected Detection Results
- **Threat Type**: social_engineering
- **Confidence Score**: 0.75-0.85
- **Detected Patterns**: urgency_language, stress_indicators, background_anomalies
- **Processing Time**: ~1.2 seconds (for 15-second audio)

## Technical Specifications
- **Format**: WAV (PCM)
- **Sample Rate**: 16kHz
- **Duration**: 15.0 seconds
- **Channels**: Mono
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit

## Testing Usage
This file serves as a comprehensive test case for:
- Social engineering pattern detection
- Voice stress analysis
- Scam call identification
- Background noise filtering
- Real-time processing performance

## Realistic Simulation
This synthetic audio incorporates real-world characteristics of
social engineering calls including:
- Authority impersonation ("This is Microsoft calling...")
- Urgency tactics ("Your computer has been compromised...")
- Credential harvesting attempts ("Please provide your...")
- Typical scam call audio artifacts
- Psychological manipulation patterns
